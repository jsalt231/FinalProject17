Welcome to Revolution Simulator 1918!
The player controls one of 3 characters: Leo (based on Leon Trotsky), Joey (Based on Josef Stalin), or Vlad (based on Vladimir Lenin).
The player goes through character selection, two combats, and one encounter to complete the game.
The are a total of 5 endings, which depend on what character the player is and whether or not they live.
While it is a relatively short game, it is still fun and challenging.
The game is unbalanced and very difficult to survive, godspeed!
